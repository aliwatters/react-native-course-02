Running through course at: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/

## eslint and beautify setup

1. See package.json and .eslintrc for rules
2. Set grammar for file to be jsx (ctrl+shift+l)
3. beautify with ctrl+alt+b

Note: object-curly-spacing rallycoding eslint conflicts with style from beautify so turned it off.
